This project consists of a website similar to IMDb, but specific to a user. Here's how it works: Let's assume there are no movies added to the site yet. Each movie to be added will be saved in a SQLite database. I visualized the database using the DB Browser for SQLite app. First, the user enters the name of a movie, then a call is made to The Movie Database API, which provides a list of movies containing the searched movie name. From that list, the user selects their movie, and then the API returns the movie cover, along with its name, description, and release year. Then the user needs to leave a brief review about the movie and give it a rating. The added movies will be sorted based on their ratings. Additionally, added movies can be deleted, automatically removing them from the database, and users can modify the rating and review if they were input incorrectly. Everything updates in real-time, and in the database, maintaining the order based on ratings.
